	<p>
		Hey there! I'm <strong>Aadhavan</strong>, a computer science student with a deep fascination for the intersection of technology and finance. My journey spans from the cutting-edge world of artificial intelligence to the analytical rigor of financial risk management.
	</p>

	<h2>Academic Journey</h2>
	<p>
		Currently pursuing my degree in Computer Science, I'm immersed in understanding both the theoretical foundations and practical applications of modern computing. My coursework has covered everything from data structures and algorithms to machine learning and software engineering principles.
	</p>

	<p>
		Simultaneously, I'm preparing for the <strong>Financial Risk Manager (FRM)</strong> exam, diving deep into quantitative finance, risk modeling, and financial markets. This dual focus gives me a unique perspective on how technology can revolutionize financial services and risk assessment.
	</p>

	<h2>Areas of Interest</h2>
	<p>
		<strong>Large Language Models & AI:</strong> I'm particularly fascinated by transformer architectures, multimodal AI systems, and the rapid evolution of text and image generation models. The potential for LLMs to transform industries is immense, and I love exploring both their capabilities and limitations.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Machine Learning & Data Science:</strong> From statistical learning theory to practical implementation of ML pipelines, I enjoy working with data to extract meaningful insights. Whether it's feature engineering, model selection, or deployment strategies, I'm always eager to learn new techniques.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Finance & Risk Management:</strong> The mathematical beauty of financial models and the challenge of quantifying uncertainty draws me to this field. I'm particularly interested in algorithmic trading, portfolio optimization, and the application of ML in finance.
	</p>

	<h2>Why "Prompt and Circumstance"?</h2>
	<p>
		The name reflects my belief that in our AI-driven world, the right prompt can unlock incredible possibilities, while understanding the circumstances—the context, limitations, and ethical implications—is equally crucial. It's a play on the famous march title, but also a nod to how we interact with and shape AI systems.
	</p>

	<p>
		Through this blog, I share my learning journey, insights from projects, and thoughts on the rapidly evolving landscape of AI and finance. Whether you're a fellow student, researcher, or industry professional, I hope you find something valuable here.
