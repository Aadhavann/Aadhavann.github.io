	<p>
		Hey there! I'm <strong>Aadhavan</strong>, a fullstack developer and AI/ML engineer passionate about building intelligent, scalable applications. I specialize in creating end-to-end solutions that leverage the latest advances in artificial intelligence and modern web technologies.
	</p>

	<h2>What I Do</h2>
	<p>
		<strong>Fullstack Development:</strong> I build modern web applications using cutting-edge frameworks and tools. From React and Astro on the frontend to Node.js and Python backends, I craft seamless user experiences backed by robust server-side architecture. I'm comfortable with the entire development lifecycle—from database design and API development to deployment and DevOps.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>AI/ML & LLMs:</strong> I'm deeply immersed in the world of artificial intelligence, particularly large language models. I develop AI-powered applications, fine-tune models, design prompt engineering systems, and integrate LLMs into production environments. From building RAG systems to creating intelligent agents, I love pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI.
	</p>

	<h2>Technical Expertise</h2>
	<p>
		<strong>Frontend:</strong> React, TypeScript, Astro, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, modern JavaScript frameworks, and responsive design principles.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Backend:</strong> Node.js, Python, FastAPI, Express, RESTful APIs, GraphQL, database design (SQL & NoSQL), and microservices architecture.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>AI/ML:</strong> Large Language Models (GPT, Claude, Llama), prompt engineering, RAG systems, vector databases, transformer architectures, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and ML deployment pipelines.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>DevOps & Tools:</strong> Docker, Git, CI/CD pipelines, cloud platforms (AWS, Azure), and modern development workflows.
	</p>

	<h2>My Approach</h2>
	<p>
		I believe in building software that's not just functional, but elegant and maintainable. Every project is an opportunity to learn new technologies, solve complex problems, and create solutions that make a real impact. I'm constantly exploring the latest developments in AI and web technologies, experimenting with new tools, and sharing what I learn through my projects.
	</p>

	<p>
		Through this project showcase, I share my work in fullstack development and AI/ML engineering. Whether you're looking to collaborate, learn, or just explore what's possible with modern technology, I hope you find inspiration here.
